    <h2><b><u>
          <center>SUN</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,[18][19]
        heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light,
        ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>MERCURY</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. Exposure to mercury – even small
      amounts – may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in
      life. Mercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and
      eyes.

          <center>VENUS</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest planet in the solar system. It is sometimes
        referred to as the sister planet to Earth, because of the similar mass and size. The planet is named after the
        Roman goddess of love and beauty. In this article, we will be discussing the characteristics and a few
        astonishing facts of Venus.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>EARTH</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      When the Earth is spoken of as a physical body, occupying space-time, it's normally preceded by the
        article, and often capitalised. As are Sun and Moon, but there's no universality about either convention, nor is
        capitalisation necessarily governed by whether the article is present or not.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>MARS</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is
        also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even
        more active in the past.

    <h2><b><u>

        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is the oldest and most massive world in the solar system. Learn about the ancient planet's origin
        story, its Great Red Spot and oceanic moons, and how this ancient world influenced the formation of the solar
        system's other planets. That includes the Great Red Spot, which is a massive hurricane-like storm called an
        anticyclone.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>SATURN</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
       Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas
        giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to
        have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>URANUS</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was
        the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William
        Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.

    <h2><b><u>
          <center>NEPTUNE</center>
        </u></b></h2>
    <p>
      Neptune, third most massive planet of the solar system and the eighth and outermost planet from the Sun.
        Because of its great distance from Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. With a small telescope, it
        appears as a tiny, faint blue-green disk.
